This visual approach references local toponymy in a respectful and original way while delivering an immediate institutional presence suitable for all applications.",
        secondaryText:
          "Symbolically and functionally, the chimpanzee serves as a strong local identifier. The shield communicates resilience, solidarity and municipal authority. The CUE banner anchors the emblem in its administrative role. The design prioritizes clarity, simplicity, adaptability and coherence. It remains legible at favicon size, impactful on large signage, and compatible with embroidery, engraving, and both monochrome and color reproduction. The identity system includes four essential layouts: Horizontal, Vertical, Logotype and Seal, with monochrome and polychrome variants. The proposed palette consists of Green #2F7A3E, Red #DB2200, Yellow #F0CD2F, Brown #7A4B2A, Orange #FE7601, and Blue #2F80ED. Typography relies on Aventa for body text and select headings, while Timeless is used for primary headings and special text. Application mockups covering signage, stationery, and digital formats illustrate potential deployment.",
