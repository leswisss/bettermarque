Concept One: The Shielded Plot was selected as the final direction. The central square symbolizes clearly defined land, while the cornered outer-frame elements create structured boundaries that convey security. The sophisticated palette of deep forest, mint, off-white, and graphite reinforces trust and natural growth. Complete deliverables included vector logo files, marketing materials, motion graphics, and Neue Montreal typography system for consistent application across all touchpoints.",
